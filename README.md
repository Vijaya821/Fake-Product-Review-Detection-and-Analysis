# Amazon Fake Reviews Detection
We collected multiple layers of Amazon product and review data to identify fake reviews. 

## Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to identifiy the fake reviews and reviewers by performing a social network analysis in conjunction with anomaly detection with clustering techniques. Developed approach to identify fake reviewers, relative to previously proposed methods has high potential for automation and enables to significantly narrow down the field and dynamically track fake reviewers.
